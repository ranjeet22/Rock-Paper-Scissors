# 🪨📄✂️ Rock Paper Scissors – Python Terminal Game

Welcome to the classic **Rock Paper Scissors** game — built with Python!  
This fun little terminal project is perfect for beginners to understand:

- 🧠 Basic Python syntax  
- 🎲 Random number generation  
- 🔁 Conditional statements  
- 🗂️ Dictionary data structures

## 🎮 Game Preview

```bash
Hey Player welcome to the GAME of...
ROCK  PAPER  SCISSOR
before we start the game...

Enter your choice : r
COMPUTER CHOSE PAPER
PLAYER CHOSE ROCK

```
## 📂 Project Structure
```bash
rock_paper_scissors/
├── rock_paper_scissors.py   # Main game logic
├── README.md                # Project documentation
```
## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ Requirements
- Python 3.x installed on your machine

### ▶️ Run the Game
Open your terminal and run:

```bash
python rock_paper_scissors.py
```

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Player inputs a character:
   - `r` → Rock  
   - `p` → Paper  
   - `s` → Scissors  

2. Computer randomly picks between rock, paper, or scissors.

3. Game prints the outcome using classic rules:
   - Rock beats Scissors  
   - Scissors beats Paper  
   - Paper beats Rock

## 🧩 Features

- 🧍 Simple text-based UI  
- 🖥️ CPU opponent using `random` module  
- 📊 Outputs result instantly  
- 🧱 Built using core Python only  

---

## ⚠️ Known Issues

- ❌ No input validation: entering anything other than `r`, `p`, or `s` will crash the program.  
  > ✅ **Planned Fix:** Add input validation to handle invalid characters.

## 📘 Concepts Used

- `random.randint()`  
- Python dictionaries (`dict`)  
- Conditional logic (`if-elif-else`)  
- Formatted printing with `f-strings`
